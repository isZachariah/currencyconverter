## XE Clone
This project is a clone of XE Currency Converter built with NextJS and React in TypeScript. I used Tailwindcss for styling. The conversions are done using a free API, the form uses query strings and React Query for caching the data. Currently the app is not deployed anywhere but I learned a lot creating it and have continued using NextJS and TypeScript in my projects.
