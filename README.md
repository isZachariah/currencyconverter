# 2. Currency Converter

Using much of what you created in Project 1, create a clone of XE Currency ExchangeLinks to an external site.. This project will be extended into Project Three. There is a lot in the designs that are meant for that extended version. Please create the html for it all but you do not need to worry about the functionality for anything but the currency convertor.

Requirements

Create a web page for the currency converter.
The page must have a header, with the stipulated links in the design. These links do not have to work right now. They will in Project 3.
A user must enter an amount. This must be formatted for them as currency.
A user can select from a list of currencies in the "From" and "To" dropdowns.
The dropdowns must display both the Currency Code and the friendly name of the currency.
A switch button is available to switch the currently selected values in the "From" and "To" dropdowns.
When a user clicks convert, the form container expands and the conversion is displayed.
Once a user clicks convert, two displays display below the main form container.
Two tables are displayed with conversion values for common increments of currency.
# EXTRA CREDIT (must do all for the full 2 points):
use the flags for a given currency to display next to the dropdown name options for From and To.
change the currency symbols for a given currency to display the related value of the currency in the To. Update the symbol when a "From" value is selected.
use the https://www.exchangerate-api.com/Links to an external site. API to get actual daily exchange rates. If you feel like you want to attempt this extra credit, I will record a video on working with an API. Much of this will also be covered in the Authentication Lab in SD 250.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
