## XE Clone
Okay, so I've spent as much time as I can before the due date getting the query strings and caching to work. The conversion page and the charts page are totally functional, other than that, sadly, not much else is. I know the main page is blank as are all other pages BUT I will carry on fleshing it out on my own. I think this starts to get the general gist of what I think you wanted this project to be. With more time I would love to implement a database and AUTH (along with the 'alerts' page.) But this is what I've got for now.
